Hi, I'm Wim. Here I share my thoughts.

I've just come out of the EF LDN 18 cohort. Previously I've worked in cybersecurity, OSS, ML, football, humanitarian orgs and charities.

I grew up just outside London, and have lived in Hong Kong, Stockholm and Helsinki. I'm always open to making new friends, to get in touch, say hi: wmvndrscht[@]gmail[.]com or [@_wvds][1] on twitter.
