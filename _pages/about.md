hi, I'm Wim! Here I share my thoughts, whatever they may be.

I've had quite some experiences, working as a cyber security consultant, malware researcher, automotive security researcher, low-level software engineer, ml engineer, ml researcher, salesman, charity worker, footballer and operations assistant.

I've also lived in London, Hong Kong, Stockholm and Helsinki, and travelled quite extensively.
