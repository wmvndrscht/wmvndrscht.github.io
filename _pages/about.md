Hi, I'm Wim! Here I share my thoughts.

To get in touch, say hi: wmvndrscht at gmail dot com or @_wvds.

I will soon start on the EF LDN 18 cohort, previously I've worked as a cyber security consultant, malware researcher, automotive security researcher, low-level software engineer, ml engineer, ml researcher, salesman, charity worker, footballer and operations assistant.

I've lived in London, Hong Kong, Stockholm and Helsinki, and love to travel.
