Recently I was struck with the power of a live violin concerto. It was euphoric. For that evening, all the clutter in my mind was removed. Instead, I was completely present, tuned into the incredible performance and those around me.

Before the performance, I'd been spiralling into work (think toxic tech founder bubble) and consuming far too much content in the form of podcasts, twitter and the news. In retrospect, what I needed was a grounding. Fortunately, that came in the form of this concert. 

Coincidentally, Riva [tweeted][1] something somewhat similar after the performance.
> "... Everyone's looking for themselves in podcasts and forgetting 500+ years of human history found it in a violin concerto."

And so, to everyone reading, I highly recommend a trip soon to watch an orchestra, opera or ballet performance.

For those wondering, the [performance][2] was by one of my favourite artists, Max Richter, performing Four Seasons recomposed outdoors at the Royal Hospital Chelsea. Huge thanks goes to Riva, who I discovered the concert through.
